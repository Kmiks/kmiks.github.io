## What’s Up With TypeScript?

TypeScript has been pretty approachable and beginner-friendly for me. I honestly wasn’t all that excited to learn it at first. I’d never even heard of TypeScript before, so I didn’t see the point in learning another language, especially since I was already comfortable with Javascript. But after getting into it, I realized how helpful it can be. It automatically points out issues before they become real problems, which saves a lot of time in debugging. Even though it can be a bit of a pain with its strict typing, I appreciate how it builds on JavaScript and adds structure. It assigns types without requiring a lot of extra effort from the developer, making things more efficient.  From a software engineering perspective, I think it's good for creating reliable and maintainable codebases. It’s a language that helps keep things organized, especially as projects grow.

## WODs: Not as Bad as I Thought…

When I first signed up for this class, I heard a lot of mixed reviews from my friends. Most of them warned me about the heavy workload and how intense the WODs were. Some even said that the WODs were the worst part of the course, with the timed aspect adding a lot of pressure. So, going into this, I had pretty low expectations and was fully prepared for a difficult  experience. I imagined myself constantly stressed, trying to keep up with the assignments and struggling through the WODs with barely enough time to finish. I figured it would be one of those classes where you're simply attempting to endure as opposed to enjoying the learning process.

Surprisingly, though, my experience so far has been much better than I anticipated. So far I like the WODs. They’ve been a good refresher for me, and I feel like they’re making me a more efficient coder. They haven’t been that stressful recently, it actually feels more like a recap than a challenge right now. As the semester continues, I’m sure it’ll get harder, and my opinion might change as the difficulty increases. But for now, the experience so far is a good way to reinforce what I’ve learned.
