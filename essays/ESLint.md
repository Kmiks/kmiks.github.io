When asked to think about coding standards, I immediately focused on small things: use spaces or tabs, curly braces go here or there. Although those little details sometimes get pretty annoying, I've come to realize that coding standards actually play a much bigger role in improving the quality of your code and your overall programming skills.

## Reunion with VSCode
I was fortunate enough to already know VSCode, having been introduced to it by my high school teacher during my sophomore year. Learning that we would be using this IDE was a  pleasant surprise, as it meant I could continue working in a familiar environment instead of switching to Eclipse or any other unfamiliar IDEs. Setting up VSCode was pretty straightforward for me, although I did need to update npm initially.

## The love-hate relationship with ESLint
In the past week, I was introduced to ESLint, a tool designed to check your code against a set of coding standards. While I appreciated its functionality in catching potential errors and enforcing best practices, I wasn't completely sold on it. On one hand, ESLint helps maintain clean code and improves overall quality; on the other hand, it usually flags warnings that feel trivial and annoying. For instance changing the indentation from a tab indent to 2 spaces. Those minior fixes were pretty tedious as I had 10+ lines to fix from copying and pasting outside code.

Despite this frustration, I can’t deny the benefits ESLint brings to my coding experience. Addressing its errors may be bothersome at times, but it encourages the development of better coding habits. By adhering to the standards that ESLint enforces, I find that my code becomes more maintainable and readable over time. The short-term hassle of fixing specific warnings is balanced by the long-term gains of writing cleaner, more organized code, ultimately reinforcing the value of using such a tool.

## Unified Code, Unified Teams

What I’ve noticed is that coding standards truly shine when working in a team environment. Time and time again, Professor Conner emphasizes that each company has its own set of coding standards. If I get used to common patterns and be able to adapt to them quickly, I’d be able to more easily collaborate on codebases. With everyone following the same set of guidelines, code becomes much more uniform and easier to understand/read.I wouldn't need to waste time deciphering individual coding styles; instead, I could just dive right into editing the code and focus on solving the problems at hand. Moreover, coding standards help prevent minor mistakes that could lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities.

## The Long-Term Value of Coding Standards
In all, coding standards are much more than just some rules about where to place spaces or how to format your code. They make you a better programmer because it instills habits that ensure your code is clean and consistent. While ESLint isn't exactly my favorite tool, I understand the importance of it. It is over time that this will make my code more reliable and easier to work with-when working with others especially.
