# Project: Dear Sunshine
##### Authors: Tiffany Duong, Casey Caro, Isabelle Castro, Lucas Corriero

## Overview

**The Problem:** Many people feel isolated or down and could use positive, uplifting messages from others to brighten their day. While social media allows people to share updates, it lacks a dedicated space for users to send and receive encouragement anonymously and with a supportive community.

**The Solution:** Dear Sunshine is a platform where users can write and send uplifting letters to people who need encouragement. The app allows users to connect through anonymous, positive messages. Additionally, users can unlock and send virtual stickers to further brighten someone's day, creating a supportive, friendly environment.


## Mockup Page Ideas
**Home Page:** The main page displays featured letters and a call-to-action for users to "Write a Letter" or "Read a Letter." The page encourages engagement with inspiring quotes or uplifting messages.

**User Profile:** Users can create anonymous profiles with minimal personalization options (like a username and avatar colors). This page displays the user’s sent letters, received responses, and earned stickers.

**Message Board:** Displays a collection of anonymous letters that users can filter by mood or theme, such as “Encouragement” or “Positive Thoughts.” Users can respond to letters or "Send Sunshine" as a virtual cheer.

**Inbox:** An organized page for users to view incoming responses to their letters, sort through replies, and archive conversations.

**Mental Help Resources:** A page with helpful links and contact information for mental health resources, including helplines and local organizations.

## Use Case Ideas
**Encouragement for Strangers:** Users can scroll through letters and pick someone to send a personalized response, providing encouragement in a meaningful, anonymous way.

**Express Gratitude or Positivity:** Users feeling particularly grateful or positive can write and post a general letter for others to read and respond to.

## Beyond the Basics
  - Weekly Letter Prompts:
      - Each week, a new prompt could encourage users to write about a specific theme, like “Hope” or “Kindness.” This feature fosters engagement and adds variety.
