## Overview

**The Problem:** Many students and community members want easy access to a variety of recipes but are often limited by time, budget, or lack of culinary experience. While recipe websites exist, they often have complicated or gourmet-level recipes that aren’t practical for a busy college lifestyle.

**The Solution:** A recipe-sharing platform tailored for simplicity and accessibility, where users can share and discover quick, easy, and budget-friendly recipes. The app would allow users to filter recipes by dietary needs, difficulty, and available equipment (e.g., microwave-only, no oven required), making it highly practical for students.

## Mockup Page Ideas
**Home Page:** Displays popular and recently added recipes, with options to filter by dietary preference, time, and budget.

**Recipe Submission Page:** Users can easily upload recipes with photos, ingredients, preparation steps, and equipment requirements.

**User Profile:** Allows users to save favorite recipes, track what they've tried, and view personal uploads.

**Community Favorites Page:** A curated selection of the top recipes based on user ratings and feedback.

## Use Case Ideas
**Quick Search:** Users looking for a fast meal can filter recipes by preparation time, budget, and dietary needs.

**User Interaction:** Users can rate, review, and save recipes, creating a community-driven ranking for each recipe.

**Recipe Sharing:** Users can share their own recipes, which will be accessible to others and allow for community feedback.

## Beyond the Basics
  - Ingredient-Based Search with Smart Substitutions:
      - Include an “ingredient-based search” where users can input ingredients they have on hand, and the app suggests recipes that can be made with those items.
  - Recipe Collections:
      - Users can create and share collections of recipes (e.g., “Easy Breakfasts” or “Healthy Snacks”) for others to explore.
  - Weekly Themes:
      - Each week, the platform features a different theme, such as “5 Ingredients or Less” or “Microwave Recipes.” Users can submit recipes that align with the theme, encouraging community engagement.
